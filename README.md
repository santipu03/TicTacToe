 - Implementation of the traditional module pattern for organizing the code.
 - Modal opens at the beggining of the game to choose names and in the end to show a motivational quote of success.
 - Each time someone uses a turn, an indicator on the top of the board switches to indicate the next turn.
 - Verification of the input names via Javascript 

# Built with:
 - HTML
 - CSS

# Reflection
This project has been complicated due to the fact that it is my first time using factory functions and modules in the code. Coding the game I've learned a lot about scope, closure, IIFE and namespacing.
